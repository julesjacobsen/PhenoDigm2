This will deploy a Solr 4.4 core and run it in a Tomcat container. It's based on
the example provided with Solr. 

Configuration:

* Set the desired values of the solr.* properties at the top of the POM.
* Edit the META-INF/context.xml so that "solr/home" environment variable points to
the ${solr.home}/${solr.core.directory}
* Change src/main/resources/*.xml to fit your needs.

Run:

mvn install will copy the files to the correct path. 
mvn package will copy and then run Solr in Tomcat.

In Netbeans just right-click the project icon and select 'run'.
